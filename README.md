# 🌍 Visualising Global Temperature Trends

## 📌 Overview
This project analyses *global land and ocean temperature records* to uncover climate trends.  
The dataset comes from the *Berkeley Earth repository, and the analysis focuses on **seasonal variations, long-term warming patterns, and smoothed moving averages*.

---

## ⚙ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

---

## ✨ Features
- Load and clean Berkeley Earth climate dataset  
- Handle missing values and convert time columns  
- Explore trends with *line plots, rolling averages, and seasonal visualisations*  
- Create *heatmaps* and *boxplots* to reveal monthly and yearly patterns  
- Export cleaned data for reuse  

---

## 📊 Visualisations
- 📈 Monthly anomalies + 12-month moving average  
- 📉 Smoothed long-term trends (3-year & 5-year rolling averages)  
- 🌡 Seasonal heatmap for the last 20 years  
- 📦 Monthly anomaly boxplots (seasonal distribution)

## 📂 Data Source
- [Berkeley Earth: Global Land and Ocean Temperature Dataset](https://berkeley-earth-temperature.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Global/Land_and_Ocean_complete.txt)

---

## 📌 Inference
- Global average temperature anomalies show a *clear warming trend*.  
- Seasonal cycles remain visible, but anomalies have *intensified in recent decades*.  
- Long-term smoothed averages confirm *accelerating climate change*.
